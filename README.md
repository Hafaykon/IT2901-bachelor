# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

### Python libraries
numpy
pandas
django
django-rest-framework
django-cors-headers

### Adding randomly chosen rows from software_per_computer to LicensePool:
INSERT INTO api_licensepool (primary_user_full_name, primary_user_email, organization, application_name, family, family_edition, computer_name)
SELECT primary_user_full_name, primary_user_email, organization, application_name, family, family_edition, computer_name
FROM api_softwarepercomputer
WHERE primary_user_full_name IS NOT NULL AND primary_user_email IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 50
